# 🌀 Hydra — Watch Anything, Anywhere, Instantly

Hydra is a **modern, open-source streaming web application** that allows you to browse and watch movies and TV shows — **completely free**, without registration, and directly in your browser.  
Powered by public APIs, it provides seamless access to entertainment content with a beautiful, responsive, and fast interface.  

---

## ✨ Features

🎬 **Stream Instantly** — Play movies and series directly using the [vidsrc.to](https://vidsrc.to) API.  
🔍 **Smart Search** — Find movies or shows quickly with live suggestions powered by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org).  
📺 **Episode Browser** — Explore seasons and episodes of your favorite series with one click.  
📈 **Discover Mode** — Filter titles by genre, rating, or year and discover trending, top-rated, and most popular content.  
🎨 **Modern UI** — Elegant design built with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui, fully responsive and dark-mode ready.  
💾 **URL Persistence** — Shareable URLs for every title and episode.  
⚙️ **No Back-End Required** — Pure Next.js client-side logic; data fetched directly from APIs.

## 🧩 How It Works

Hydra doesn’t host or store any videos.  
Instead, it acts as a **content aggregator**, fetching metadata and video sources from external providers:

- 🎥 **[vidsrc.to](https://vidsrc.to)** → provides video embedding sources for movies and TV shows.  
- 🎞️ **[The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org)** → provides metadata like posters, ratings, plots, and genres.  

All data is dynamically fetched and rendered client-side, so users can explore, filter, and play content in real time.
